Hi! My name is Sean, and I am a skilled software engineer with over 8 years of experience, focused on web scraping and scalable data pipelines. Although I have been a software engineer since college, I now want to pursue my true passion of working with electrical and mechanical systems.

My interest in machines started at a young age, watching BattleBots and How It's Made on the Discovery Channel. Watching combat robotics again inspired me to make my own PLAntweight robot this year. I 3D-printed the frame, learned how to select electrical components and solder them together, and set up the radio transmitter. Even when I was frustrated, the process was still fun and engaging. I loved being able to use my existing skills while learning new ones, and I'm hoping to compete in a tournament soon! I've also built my own FPV drone and electric skateboard based on existing DIY designs, adapted to the parts I could get a hold of in these volatile times.

Ultimately I want to work hands-on in an industrial setting, leveraging my past programming expertise as well. My sense of satisfaction comes from making a positive difference: whether it's volunteering in my community, keeping vital operations running, or reducing a facility's energy usage. Now that I've learned how to solder and use a multimeter, my next goal is to learn how to program PLCs using ladder logic, and get better at 3D modeling. Thank you for following my journey!
