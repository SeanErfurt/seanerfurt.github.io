Let me walk you my journey of building a small, 1-pound (or 454-gram) robot, often called an "Antweight" or "Plastic Antweight." This is the perfect place to start, as it lets you learn all the core skills without a massive investment in parts.

Phase 1: Planning, Printing, and Sourcing Parts
Before even picking up a soldering iron, I first needed to choose a design. It's highly recommended to use a proven, open-source design, so I went with the "Force Knight" provided by [Team Malice](http://url-you-want-linked). Their designs are meant to work with the [SCAR PLANT Drive Kit](https://turnabot.com/products/scar-plant-turnakit) offered by Turnabot, simplifying the parts-sourcing task, and ensuring compliance with the SCAR tournament rules.

The SCAR PLAntweight class rules restrict us to PLA and PLA+, and we will be using both. The spinner weapon is printed solid out of PLA+. I experimented with using 99% concentric infill vs. using 100 perimeters/walls. Both printed fine but 99% concentric was more dimensionally accurate. We'll see which one is stronger! For the armor, I'm trying out different colors/formulations of PLA. The red is PLA-HS, which is stiffer and lighter, but may shatter more easily. It will be interesting to see which is better suited for the job!
